#JSONVoorhees
An _extremely_ simple little plugin to open a file with a machete and throw a key:value pair into the JSON contained within.

###Why would you need such a thing?
I made it to update a config file with new hash-specific filenames created by Gulp, because I got tired of updating them by hand.

###Does it even do multi-dimensional Json objects?
Only if you pass it in to the _val_ parameter.  Otherwise, it's all top-level, baby, cause that's what I needed it to do and I banged this thing out in like 3 hours.

###Can I contribute?
Absolutely.  Fork it and make a pull request.  Your mama will be proud of you, and you'll have my appreciation.

Thanks!  Ingus
